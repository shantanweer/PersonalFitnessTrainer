# Personal Fitness Trainer
#Simple front end design for a fitness website

This project consists of an HTML website for a personal fitness trainer. It provides information about the trainer's services, contact details, and a thank you page for submitting information.

## Index.html

The `index.html` file is the main page of the website. It includes the following sections:

- **Header**: Displays the website title and a navigation menu.
- **Home Section**: Provides an introduction to the personal fitness trainer and their goals. It includes a call-to-action button to contact them.
- **Services Section**: Describes the various services offered by the personal fitness trainer, including personalized training programs, nutritional guidance, progress monitoring, goal-specific training, and motivation/support.
- **Contact Section**: Contains a contact form for users to get in touch with the trainer.
- **Footer**: Displays copyright information and a link to the developer's LinkedIn profile.

## Thanks.html

The `thanks.html` file is a separate page that users are directed to after submitting the contact form. It includes a simple message thanking the user for their submission and providing reassurance that the trainer will respond soon. It also offers a button to go back to the main page.

## Additional Files

The project also includes the following files:

- **style.css**: The CSS file that contains the styling rules for the website.
- **logo.jpg**: The logo image used in the website's favicon.
- **ServiceX.jpg**: Images representing the different services offered by the personal fitness trainer.
- **script.js**: A JavaScript file that may contain additional functionality for the website.

Feel free to explore the HTML and CSS files to understand the structure and design of the website.
